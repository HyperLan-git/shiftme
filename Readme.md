# ShiftMe
Frequency shifting, as simple as it can be.

## Dependencies
On windows, you just need Visual Studio 2022 and Juce.
In addition to juce's main dependencies on linux, you'll need libasan to compile in debug mode.

## How to compile
On windows, simply open the project from projucer and build the solution you need.

On linux, use the makefile :
```sh
make
```

To compile in Release mode (with optimisations and no memory sanitizer), use `make CONFIG=Release`.
You can clean binaries with `make clean`.
